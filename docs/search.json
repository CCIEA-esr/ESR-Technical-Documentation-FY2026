    "text": "Preface\nThis document is our initial attempt at consolidating in one place the detailed methods used to collect and analyze the indicator data presented in the California Current Ecosystem Status Report (ESR). This online technical documentation archive is designed to serve as a repository for the methods used to access, collect, process, and analyze the indicators presented in the report, while also reducing the length of the ESR and the redundancy among the annual reports.\nThis repository will be provided both as an online website https://cciea-esr.github.io/ESR-Technical-Documentation-FY2026/ and a time-stamped Appendix (Appendix V) to the 2025-26 report, until it is reviewed by the SSC and Council. Thereafter, however, we intend for it to exist solely as an evolving online repository that documents changes to the indicator portfolio, the source data, and the methods used to derive them.\nChapters of this document are organized similarly to the structure of the ESR (i.e. one “chapter” of the technical documentation per section of the ESR). In some cases, we also may also include detailed methods for indicators that no longer are published in the most current version of the ESR document.\nWe thank the scientists at the Northeast Fisheries Science Center (DePiper et al. 2017) who provided the inspiration and initial template for some of this work https://noaa-edab.github.io/tech-doc/index.html.",

    "text": "The purpose of this document is to collate the methods used to access, collect, process, and analyze derived data (“indicators”) used to describe the status and trend of social, economic, ecological, and biological conditions in the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (see Fig. 1, below). These indicators are further synthesized in Ecosystem Status Reports produced annually by the Northwest and Southwest Fisheries Science Centers for the Pacific Fisheries Management Council. The metadata for each indicator (in accordance with the Public Access to Research Results (PARR) directive) and the methods used to construct each indicator are described in the subsequent chapters, with each chapter title corresponding to an indicator or analysis present in Ecosystem Status Reports. The most recent and usable html version of this document can be found at https://cciea-esr.github.io/ESR-Technical-Documentation-FY2026/. The PDF version of this and future versions document will be archived in NOAA’s Institutional Repository.\nIndicators included in this document were selected to clearly align with management objectives, which is required for integrated ecosystem assessment (Levin et al. 2009), and has been advised many times in the literature (Degnbol and Jarre 2004; Jennings 2005; Rice and Rochet 2005; Link 2005). A difficulty with practical implementation of this in ecosystem reporting can be the lack of clearly specified ecosystem-level management objectives (although some have been suggested (Murawski 2000)). In our case, considerable effort had already been applied to derive both general goals and operational objectives from both US legislation such as the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act (MSA) and regional sources (Harvey et al. 2021).\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDegnbol, P., and A.

Key oceanographic transects are the Newport Line off Oregon, the Trinidad Head Line off northern California, and CalCOFI lines further south, while shaded marine regions indicate sampling areas for most biological surveys. This sampling is complemented by basin-scale oceanographic observations and by outputs from various models. Figure 1 also shows sampling areas for most biological indicators. The shaded terrestrial areas in Figure 1 represent freshwater ecoregions in the CCE, and are the basis by which we summarize indicators for snowpack, flows, and stream temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Map of most sampling efforts in the California Current Ecosystem (CCE) and U.S. west coast Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

Shaded ocean regions represent biological sampling areas for the Northern California Current (NCC), which includes the Juvenile Salmon and Ocean Ecology Survey (JSOES); the Rockfish Recruitment and Ecosystem Assessment Survey (RREAS), including its Core Area; and the CalCOFI sampling region. The NCC and RREAS shaded areas, combined, also approximate the survey footprints for NOAA’s coastwide CPS acoustic/trawl and groundfish bottom trawl surveys.

In this technical documentation, we list the derived indicators, their source, and where possible, the computations used to produce them from the raw data. This metadata is also publicly available for download. The derived indicator data can be downloaded using links in the sections of this document unless there are privacy concerns involved. In that case, it may be possible to access source data by reaching out to the Data Steward associated with that data set.\nData flow Indicator data is submitted by data providers in a standard format consisting of “long” csv files with standardized column headers and consistent file names. These requirement allow all indicators to be handled with the same R plotting code and enable automation of the data upload process.\nAfter uploading, standardized data and metadata is organized on a private Google Drive by ESR year, and served publicly via ERDDAP™ (Simons and John 2022)\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimons, RA, and Chris John. 2022. “ERDDAP.” NOAA/NMFS/SWFSC/ERD. 2022. https://coastwatch.pfeg.noaa.gov/erddap.",

Black points (when included) indicate data, whereas dotted black lines are used to indicate missing data. The arrow at the right indicates if the trend over the evaluation period (shaded blue) is positive (↗), negative (↘), or neutral (↔︎). The symbol at the lower right indicates if the recent mean was greater than (+), less than (-), or within 1.0 SD of the long-term mean. When possible, times series indicate observation error (gray envelope), defined for each plot (e.g., SD, standard error, or 95% confidence intervals).\nIn some cases where the indicator has defined threshold values (e.g., hypoxia or domoic acid toxicity levels), the time-series plot (b) shows the indicator data relative to these threshold value, indicated with a blue line. In this case, dashed lines indicate upper and lower observation error, and the dotted black lines indicate missing data.\nSample quad plots (c) are also used in some other cases (e.g., streamflow), where each point represents one normalized time series. The position of a point indicates if the recent trend (x-axis) was increasing or decreasing over the evaluation period and whether the recent mean (y-axis) was above or below the evaluation period mean. Symbols fall therefore fall into quadrants based on recent average (high or low) and recent trend (increasing or decreasing) relative to a defined, long-term evaluation period.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: a) Sample time-series plot, with indicator data relative to the mean (black dashed horizontal line) and ±1.0 standard deviation (SD; solid blue lines) of the long-term statistical evaluation period (1991-2020).

El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events impact the CCLME by modifying the jet stream and storm tracks, changing the nearshore thermocline, and influencing coastal currents that affect poleward transport and distribution of equatorial and subequatorial waters (and species). The status of the equatorial ENSO is described by the Oceanic Niño Index, which tracks the running 3-month average sea surface temperatures in the east-central tropical Pacific between 120°-170°W. An ONI above 0.5°C indicates El Niño conditions, which often lead to lower primary production, weaker upwelling, poleward transport of equatorial waters and species, and more southerly storm tracks in the CCE. An ONI below -0.5°C means La Niña conditions, which create atmospheric pressure conditions that lead to upwelling-favorable winds that drive productivity in the CCE.\nOceanic Nino Index\n\nComponent Category: Climate and Ocean Drivers\nTime Range: 1950 - 2025\nCCIEA Data Contact: isaac.schroeder@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA, Climate Prediction Center (CPC)\nSource Data: NOAA/CPC The ONI is the 3 month running mean of sea surface temperature anomalies in the Nino 3.4 region\nDownload data:  csv file",

    "text": "Description The Habitat Compression Index (HCI) is the area of cool habitat along the coast, which is suitable for a diverse and productive portion of the CCE food web. HCI is estimated in four biogeographic provinces along the shelf within the CCE.

Grid points between 30-48 degrees N and from the shore out to 150 km offshore are used in the analysis.\nAdditional Calculations: In eastern boundary upwelling ecosystems the spatial footprint of cool upwelled water is regularly demarcated by the differential boundary of warmer oceanic water offshore from cooler coastal water, with upwelling conditions varying with latitude. Therefore, the goal of the habitat compression index (HCI) is to track the area of cool surface waters as an index of potential ‘upwelling habitat’ for assessing the spatio-temporal aspects of upwelling. Upwelling patterns of cold nutrient-rich water are clearly assessed by models and satellite observations and classified spatially by monitoring SST values less than and equal to a monthly resolved temperature threshold. The HCI tracks the amount of area, determined by the number of grid cells in the model with 2 m surface temperature values less than the monthly temperature threshold, therefore the time series reflects the area of cool water adjacent to the coastline and provides a measure for how compressed cool surface temperatures may be in a particular month. In this study (Schroeder et al. 2022), we extracted modeled 2 m temperature fields over the domain of 35.5-40 degree N for each month and tracked the amount of area with temperature values less than and equal to a monthly temperature threshold, resulting in monthly time series starting January 1980. Monthly temperature thresholds for a given month is the spatial average of 2 m temperature grid cells between 35.5-40N from shore out to 75 km for the time period 1980-2010. Cool expansion periods (low compression) are defined as months with HCI values exceeding + 1 standard deviation (SD) of the full time series, limited cool habitat (high compression) where area of cool water is less than the mean (MN) of the full time series, and periods of medium compression when the area of cool water falls between the +1 SD and the MN.\nDownload data:  csv file\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSantora, Jarrod A, Nathan J Mantua, Isaac D Schroeder, John C Field, Elliott L Hazen, Steven J Bograd, William J Sydeman, et al. 2020. “Habitat compression and ecosystem shifts as potential links between marine heatwave and record whale entanglements.” Nature Communications 11 (1): 1–12.\n\n\nSchroeder, Isaac D, Jarrod A Santora, Nate Mantua, John C Field, Brian K Wells, Elliott L Hazen, Michael Jacox, and Steven J Bograd. 2022. “Habitat Compression Indices for Monitoring Ocean Conditions and Ecosystem Impacts Within Coastal Upwelling Systems.” Ecological Indicators 144: 109520.",

CUTI provides estimates of vertical transport near the coast (i.e., upwelling/downwelling). It was developed as a more accurate alternative to the previously available ‘Bakun Index’. BEUTI provides estimates of vertical nitrate flux near the coast (i.e., the amount of nitrate upwelled/downwelled), which may be more relevant than upwelling strength when considering some biological responses.\nThe historical Bakun (Bakun (1973); Bakun (1975)) upwelling indices provide long time series of upwelling, and are based on estimates of offshore Ekman transport driven by geostrophic wind stress. Geostrophic winds are derived from mean surface atmospheric pressure fields provided by the U.S. Navy Fleet Numerical Meteorological and Oceanographic Center (FNMOC), Monterey, CA.\nTime series of the upwelling indices provide information on upwelling strength at sub-seasonal frequency and upwelling phenology, and allow interannual comparisons of seasonal upwelling timing and frequency. Additionally, the calculation of cumulative upwelling allows for a comparison of the total amount of upwelling a region receives during the entire course of the year. Cumulative upwelling is calculated as the daily summation of upwelling values (additive for positive upwelling, and subtractive for negative upwelling - aka downwelling) starting on Jan 1 and ending on Dec 31st.\nCoastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI)\n\n\nLatitudes:\n\n33 N\n39 N\n45 N\n\nComponent Category: Climate and Ocean Drivers\nTime Range: 1988 - 2025\nCCIEA Data Contact: isaac.schroeder@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA/SWFSC/ERD\nSource Data: CUTI is a new upwelling index that leverages state-of-the-art ocean models as well as satellite and in situ data to improve upon historically available upwelling indices for the U.S. west coast.

DO is required for organismal respiration; low DO can compress habitat and cause stress or die-offs for sensitive species. Waters with DO levels &lt;1.4 mL/L (~ 2 mg/L, note unit change) are considered to be hypoxic; such conditions may occur on the shelf following the onset of spring upwelling, and continue into the summer and early fall months until the fall transition vertically mixes shelf waters. Upwelling-driven hypoxia occurs because upwelled water from deeper ocean sources tends to be low in DO, and microbial decomposition of organic matter in the summer and fall increases overall system respiration and oxygen consumption, particularly closer to the seafloor (Chan et al. 2008).\nCalCOFI Indicators\n\n\nLocations:\n\n150m: Line 80, Station 80 (33.5 N, -122.5 E)\n150m: Line 90, Station 90 (31.4 N, -122 E)\n150m: Line 93, Station 30 (32.8 N, -117.5 E)\n\nComponent Category: Climate and Ocean Drivers\nTime Range: 1950 - 2025\nCCIEA Data Contact: isaac.schroeder@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA SWFSC\nSource Data: Isaac Schroeder (isaac.schroeder@noaa.gov) Dissolved oxygen is measured by an automated oxygen titrator mounted to the CTD rosette and oxygen data is sampled at depths consistent with those of temperature and salinity.

Upwelling transports low oxygen, acidified waters from deeper offshore onto the continental shelf, where increased community-level metabolic activity can further exacerbate OA (Feely et al. 2008). A key measure of OA is aragonite saturation state, which is related to availability of aragonite (a form of the mineral calcium carbonate) to form or dissolve. Aragonite saturation &lt;1.0 indicates relatively acidified, corrosive conditions that are stressful for many CCE species, particularly shell-forming invertebrates.

Northern copepods usually dominate the summer zooplankton community along the Newport Line, while southern species dominate winter. Positive northern copepod anomalies generally correlate with stronger returns of Chinook salmon to Bonneville Dam and coho salmon to coastal Oregon (Peterson et al. 2014).

The survey targets young-of-the-year (YOY) rockfish species and a variety of other YOY and adult forage species, market squid, adult krill, and gelatinous zooplankton. Juvenile rockfish, anchovy, krill, and market squid are among the most important prey for CCE predators (Szoboszlai et al. 2015). Time series presented here are from the “Core Area” of that survey, centered off Monterey Bay. Catch data were standardized by using a delta-GLM to estimate year effects while accounting for spatial and temporal covariates to yield relative abundance indices, shown with their approximate 95% confidence limits (Santora et al. 2021). This modeling approach was adopted in recent reports to reduce bias in 2020, when sampling effort and spatial coverage was severely constrained by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPelagic forage data from the Central CCE were provided by J.

The surveys cover waters to at least the 1,000-fathom (1829-m) isobath, or 65 km from shore.\nThe five most abundant CPS in this domain are Northern Anchovy, Pacific Herring, Pacific Sardine, Jack Mackerel, and Pacific Mackerel. The biomass of Pacific Sardine is calculated separately for the northern and southern stocks based on oceanographic habitat, spatial separation, and demographic structure (Zwolinski and Demer 2024). The ATM combines data from echosounders which record CPS echoes, and trawls which produce information about the composition, sizes, and ages of the fishes. This survey also samples the densities of CPS eggs at 3-m depth using a continuous underway fish egg sampler (CUFES) mounted on the ship’s hull.\nCPS surveys typically span the area between Cape Flattery, WA and San Diego,CA but in some years also include Vancouver Island, Canada (2015-2019) and portions of Baja CA (2021-2022).\nIndicator Category Ecological Integrity\nData Steward K.

For each cell within a given indicator, we determined how many standard deviations the values were from their respective base period mean and used a five-color set to indicate whether a value was &gt;2 s.d. below the mean, 1 to 2 s.d. below the mean, within 1 s.d. of the mean in either direction, 1 to 2 s.d. above the mean, or &gt;2 s.d. above the mean. This approach overcomes many of the issues that had been previously identified (e.g., better highlighting values that represent truly exceptional years; past values are now static and do not suddenly change colors; etc.).\nCentral California Current; Klamath / Sacramento / Central Valley stocks: The process of identifying key indicators for salmon habitat stoplight tables is ongoing (Munsch et al. in prep). To summarize our approach and findings to date, we used linear models to relate recruitment of SRFC, CVSC, and KRFC to salmon habitat indicators. In light of the potential for recruitment-indicator relationships to change over time, we selected indicators based on model performance metrics that suggested that the indicators were persistently or recently important to recruitment. Through preliminary analyses, we selected twelve key indicators, two of which are shared among the California Central Valley stocks (SRFC and CVSC) for a total of ten unique indicators. We note that we only found strong evidence for a linear relationship between natural spawners and future recruitment for SRFC (and thus use this indicator for forecasts below), but report natural spawner counts for other stocks for context. Our ongoing analyses will examine for evidence of a Ricker stock-recruitment relationship, which is not included here.\nWe also report new efforts to examine thiamine deficiency in hatchery eggs across the Central Valley in California. Some of the indicators we selected, particularly those relevant to SRFC, have been identified as important by previous research efforts (Friedman et al. 2019; Munsch et al. 2020, 2022). Indicators were indexed according to brood year or outmigration year and then adjusted to return or fishing year via the assumptions that juveniles migrated the calendar year after their brood year and that most adults were harvested or returned as spawners three years after their brood year.\n[this section will require a bit more writing to incorporate evolving approaches and methods]\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriedman, Whitney R, Benjamin T Martin, Brian K Wells, Pete Warzybok, Cyril J Michel, Eric M Danner, and Steven T Lindley. 2019. “Modeling composite effects of marine and freshwater processes on migratory species.” Ecosphere 10 (7): e02743.\n\n\nMunsch, Stuart H, Correigh M Greene, Rachel C Johnson, William H Satterthwaite, Hiroo Imaki, Patricia L Brandes, and Michael R O’Farrell. 2020. “Science for integrative management of a diadromous fish stock: interdependencies of fisheries, flow, and habitat restoration.” Canadian Journal of Fisheries and Aquatic Sciences 77 (9): 1487–1504.\n\n\nMunsch, Stuart H, Correigh M Greene, Nathan J Mantua, and William H Satterthwaite. 2022. “One Hundred-Seventy Years of Stressors Erode Salmon Fishery Climate Resilience in California’s Warming Landscape.” Global Change Biology 28 (7): 2183–2201.",

    "text": "Description. Central Valley Fall Chinook salmon stoplight table: In the 2019-2020 ecosystem status report (Harvey et al. 2020), we introduced a relatively simple “stoplight” table of ecosystem indicators that were shown by Friedman et al. (2019) to be correlated with returns of naturally produced Central Valley Fall Chinook salmon. In an updated stoplight chart for adult Fall Chinook salmon returning to the Central Valley in 2024, the focal ecosystem indicators are: spawning escapement of parent generations; egg incubation temperature between October and December at Red Bluff Diversion Dam (Sacramento River); egg thiamine concentrations based on averages of samples collected from Central Valley fall run hatchery programs; median flow in the Sacramento River in the February after fry emergence; and a marine predation index based on the abundance of common murres at Southeast Farallon Island and the proportion of juvenile salmon in their diets. Reflecting discussions with the SSC-ES in September 2020, we emphasize that this stoplight chart is strictly qualitative and contextual decision-support information. Qualitative descriptors (color-coded terms like “very poor”) are based on recent time series and on expert opinion of how a given indicator relates to quantitative analysis of the relationship between the indicator and life-stage specific survival (see Figure 5 in Friedman et al. 2019). For example, in the stoplight Table flows rated “very low” (&lt;7,000 cfs) are consistent with &lt;25% rearing/outmigration survival rates, while the flows rated “low” (7,000 to 20,000 cfs) were consistent with 25-50% outmigrant survival (see Fig. 5 in, Friedman et al. 2019). Egg incubation temperatures in the Table were consistent with egg-to-fry survival ranging from ~50% (which we rated as “suboptimal”) to 0% at &gt; 13 C (“very poor/cohort failure”). We continue to refine these qualitative categories for future reports so that their basis is more explicit.\nThe escapement descriptor is a qualitative evaluation of how natural-area escapement of a parent generation relates to the natural area + hatchery escapement goal of 122,000– 180,000 fish, with 122,000 spawners as the SMSY target (PFMC 2022d). Natural area escapement is relevant to the stoplight table as an indicator of total natural area egg production (Munsch et al. 2020). However, the qualification of this indicator requires future research. Obviously, using a natural+hatchery target as the qualifier for natural-only escapement is problematic. Perhaps more importantly, the SSC and STT have both recommended research and reconsideration of the Sacramento River fall Chinook SMSY objective (PFMC 2022e,f), and W. Satterthwaite (2022) has concluded that an escapement of 122,000 adults is insufficient to maximize natural production. We have not been able to fully address the SSC and SST comments yet.\nThe qualitative nature of this stoplight table is in part due to the fact that some of the parameters used by Friedman et al. (2019) were estimated using information from both natural-origin and hatchery-origin fish, and while it is reasonable to assume that true parameter values would be similar, given correlations between natural and hatchery escapements, additional data specific to natural-origin fish are likely necessary in order to improve model fits, evaluate other potential covariates, and support adequate testing of model predictive skill.\n[include here Table J.1 which documents the habitat indicators, definitions, and key references]\nIndicator Category Ecological Integrity\nData Steward Greene and Munsch; correigh.greene@noaa.gov, stuart.munsch@noaa.gov\nInstitution NOAA NWFSC\nAdditional Information Data are collected and analyzed independently by C. Greene and S. Munsch, who submitted unpublished tables and figures to the CCIEA editorial team. This work is under review by the PFMC Scientific and Statistical Committee. The complete documentation of these methods is a work in progress and will likely be completed after publication of the associated, peer-reviewed scientific manuscript.\nData sources The indicators representing Ecosystem conditions for California Chinook salmon have been shown in previous studies or were proposed in rebuilding plans to be strongly related with life-stage specific Chinook salmon productivity, and these studies helped determine expected directionality of indicators with stock productivity (see below and Harvey et al. (2020) for additional justification). Four of the five broad categories of indicators in the stoplight charts align with the simpler stoplight chart for Central Valley fall Chinook salmon presented in the main body of the report: Adult Spawners, Incubation conditions, Freshwater / Estuarine Residence conditions, and Marine Residence conditions (for the first year of marine residence). The fifth category of indicators, Hatchery Releases, expands the scope of these tables relative Table 3.2, which focuses only on natural-area fish. The habitat indicator charts also share qualities with the stoplight chart developed for Columbia Basin Chinook salmon and Oregon coast coho salmon by including regional and basin-scale oceanographic indicators as part of early marine residence conditions. Data on krill off northern California are also presented within the table for KRFC.\nThe indicators in Table J.1 and in the stoplight tables above have undergone several important adjustments from previous reports:\nUpdates to SRFC and KRFC include changes in some indicators to ensure more reliable and timely data capture. However, updates of many indicators in 2023 remain challenging due to delays in posting of online datasets, resulting in several indicators that could not be updated for this year’s report and preliminary estimates for several others. These challenges underscore the importance of including multiple indicators, highlight the potential fragility of these annual summaries, and point to the importance of many individuals for maintaining the databases required for summarizing habitat indicators.\nRecent analysis of krill off northern California have revealed that krill length is a much better indicator than krill biomass for predicting productivity of Klamath Fall run, so we have substituted length for this indicator.\nCVSC differs from SRFC not only in migration timing but also in their behavior and spatial distribution. Habitat indicators reflect these differences, by characterizing early upstream migration starting in February, holding in pools through the summer, and spawning in a small number of creeks in the late summer and fall. Adult numbers focused on spawner counts in Butte, Mill, and Deer Creeks. Butte Creek spawners migrate from the Sacramento River through Sutter Bypass to Butte Creek, and outmigrants may rear within Sutter Bypass during outmigration. Hence, flow and temperature metrics relied on gages from these systems in addition to the Sacramento mainstem, and Sutter Bypass inundation instead of Yolo Bypass. Finally, the sole hatchery for CVSC is from Feather River, so releases and timing metrics focused on data from just this hatchery.\nThe stoplight tables are categorized from favorable to poor conditions using the same approach as described for the Northern California Current salmon indicator stoplight table. Specifically, after indicator datasets were collected, all indicators were “directionalized” to account for their expected relationships with stock productivity (based on the “Effect” column in (Table J.1) and converted into standardized values. These values are reported in the stoplight tables above, with colors delineating statistically meaningful departures (&gt;2 s.d.) toward poorer (warm shades) or more productive (cool shades) conditions compared to near-average years (within ±1 s.d., yellow). The main difference for the tables shown here relative to Columbia River salmon stoplight tables is that we have not yet determined a fixed historic reference period for the SRFC, KRFC and CVSC tables, due in part to missing data from one or more indicators in large portions of the time series.\nHabitat Indicator Descriptions. Adults returning and migrating to spawning grounds: Spawning adults set the cohort size (Friedman et al. 2019) and potential for density-dependent habitat limitations at future life stages (Munsch et al. 2020), so we incorporated estimated escapements from PFMC preseason forecasts. Adults must navigate multiple potential barriers to reach spawning grounds, including low river flows and high temperatures at the end of summer. We used flow and temperature measurements from the lower portions of the Sacramento and Klamath Rivers in September and October. In the Sacramento River, adults must also navigate the channel network of the delta, and the rebuilding plan proposed examining potential effects of the Delta Cross Channel as a migration barrier. We used the proportion of time the Cross Channel was closed in September and October as the indicator.\nIndicators for adult migrations differ for CVSC due to their early migration timing (February to May), spring-summer holding in pools, and spawning in a small number of Sacramento tributaries. We restricted the enumerated spawner abundance to Deer, Mill, and Butte Creeks, for which records were consistently maintained throughout the 1983-present period of record. To fill in data gaps of spawner counts for Butte Creek (the largest spawning population) to complete the retrospective time series to the 1983 brood year, we used predictions from regressions of Butte Creek spawner counts and snorkel surveys. Flows and temperatures during holding were restricted to the river with the greatest spawner abundance (Butte Creek). In addition, CDFW conducts estimates of pre-spawn mortality which we added as an indicator due to CVSC’s exposure to warm in-river conditions.\nIncubation to emergence: After spawning, incubating eggs may be subject to dewatering in the river (Jager et al. 1997) and are sensitive to high temperatures (Friedman et al. 2019). For SRFC, the river flow indicator was derived from the seven-day 10th percentile of flow for the Sacramento River from October to December at Bend Bridge near Red Bluff. For CVSC, we used similar flow conditions for Butte Creek. For KRFC, dewatering previously was observed in various tributaries of the Klamath. Hence, minimum flows from four gages (Klamath at Iron Gate, Scott River, Shasta River, and Trinity River at Lewiston Dam) were used, and the index was calculated from the average of standardized flow values. Incubation temperature records were obtained for all three river systems, albeit for a much shorter time series in the Klamath. SRFC incubation temperature estimates are from Red Bluff Diversion Dam (data in Friedman et al. 2019), CVSC records are from Butte Creek, and Klamath records are from Seiad Valley. Egg-fry productivity as measured by migrants per spawner were initiated in the early 2000s for all stocks.\nFreshwater and estuary residence: During migration to the ocean, fall Chinook salmon stocks take advantage of temporary residence in riverine and estuary habitats before transitioning to marine environments. We used a variety of indicators of habitat conditions during this stage. Freshwater conditions are set by precipitation and spring air temperatures, both of which influence snowpack salmon runs and river flow (Munsch et al. 2019) in both tributaries (important for CVSC in particular) and mainstem. In turn, flows from December to May (and their temporal variation) set conditions for rearing in river and estuary systems as fish move downstream, and have been linked to freshwater (Munsch et al. 2019) and life-cycle productivity (Michel 2019, Friedman et al. 2019). Higher flows also determine access to floodplain rearing in reaches such as the Yolo Bypass for SRFC (Limm and Marchetti 2009) and Sutter Bypass for CVSC, as well as the potential to flush polychaete hosts of the parasite Ceratomyxa shasta that infects juvenile salmon during outmigration (Jordan 2012). Flows also determine the outflow through the Sacramento delta (Reis et al. 2019), which can influence estuarine rearing opportunities (Munsch et al. 2020). To shift freshwater flows to pumping facilities, the Bureau of Reclamation opens the Delta Cross Channel, and this pathway can entrain salmon in pumps or otherwise expose them to higher mortality (Perry et al. 2013).\nMagnitude and timing of hatchery releases: While much of the habitat indicators focus on natural-area fish, hatchery releases make up a significant contribution of each run and may also contribute to density dependence. We therefore included the annual total of hatchery releases, using data from up to four SRFC hatcheries on the Sacramento (San Joaquin hatcheries were not included), the Feather River hatchery for CVSC, and Trinity and Iron Gate hatcheries in the Klamath. While hatchery-origin juveniles are also sensitive to the conditions natural-origin juveniles face, they are generally raised until they are primed for rapid migration. Following concepts of match-mismatch theory (Cushing 1990), we compared release date with the date of peak spring flow in freshwater and the spring transition in the ocean, as W. H. Satterthwaite et al. (2014) showed that both timing of release relative to the spring transition and overall later release timing were positively correlated with survival rates. Fates of hatchery fish may be a consequence of release location (Sturrock et al. 2019), including locations external to the Sacramento River system, so we also included the proportion of releases that were seaward of Sherman Island in the lower delta.\nMarine residence: Marine residence of 1 to 5 years completes the life cycle for fall run Chinook salmon populations. While a broad number of marine habitat indicators have been examined (Wells et al. 2008), we focused on a limited subset of possible indicators representing initial set-up of ocean entry conditions (March-May), including sea surface temperature, the North Pacific Index, and North Pacific Gyre Oscillation. We also included an index of predation by common murres nesting at Southeast Farallon Island, which was a strong predictor in Friedman et al. (2019). Unfortunately, this indicator currently cannot be updated quantitatively. On the positive side, we have updated the krill prey indicator for Klamath River fall Chinook salmon from biomass to average length to better reflect stronger correlations with recruits per spawner. Where indicators were averaged to obtain a marine habitat conditions score, hatchery release timing relative to the spring transition was also included as a marine habitat condition.\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriedman, Whitney R, Benjamin T Martin, Brian K Wells, Pete Warzybok, Cyril J Michel, Eric M Danner, and Steven T Lindley. 2019. “Modeling composite effects of marine and freshwater processes on migratory species.” Ecosphere 10 (7): e02743.\n\n\nHarvey, Chris J, Newell Toby Garfield, Gregory D Williams, and Nicholas Tolimieri. 2020. “California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (CCIEA) California Current Ecosystem Status Report, 2020.

Strong year classes can determine age structure and set stock size for marine fishes, and may also indicate favorable environmental conditions, increased future catches, and impending potential bycatch issues. Here, we provide estimates of juvenile abundance for 13 species of West Coast groundfishes, including four from DTS assemblage (Dover sole, thornyheads, and sablefish) as a potential leading indicator of incoming strong year classes. The DTS assemblage is a valuable fishery, and bycatch of some species, like small sablefish, can impact other fisheries such as the at-sea hake fishery.\nIndicator Category Ecological Integrity\nData Steward N. Tolimieri, NMFS/NWFSC (nick.tolimieri@noaa.gov)\nAdditional Information Data are collected and analyzed independently by N. Tolimieri, who submits unpublished figures and plots to the CCIEA editorial team.\nData sources Data for indicators come from the West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS) (Keller et al. 2017) for 2003-2021. There were no data for 2020 because the WCGBTS was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey data includes estimates of age, length, and biomass for subsamples of each haul, and occasionally for the entire haul when catch is low.\nData extraction Data were downloaded from the Fishery Resource Analysis and Monitoring data Warehouse (https://www.webapps.nwfsc.noaa.gov/data/map)\nData analysis We used species distribution models to calculate indices of abundance for juvenile groundfish. The approach follows the general approach of Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) but uses the ‘sdmTMB’ package (Anderson et al. 2022) for R instead of the ‘VAST’ package (Thorson 2019). VAST was was reviewed by the SSC-ES in September 2021. The sdmTMB approach is used by many West Coast groundfish stock assessment biologists to assimilate survey data and was reviewed favorably by the SSC-Groundfish Subcommittee in summer of 2022 (PFMC 2022c).\nThe analyses estimate the biomass for each species by using length-age and length-weight relationships to expand the trawl data. Length is measured (cm total length) for all individuals in the subsample, but many individual fishes lack weight or age data due to time constraints in the field and ageing lab. To expand the subsample,\n\nMissing weights for individuals in the subsample were obtained by first estimating the length-weight relationship from existing data and using this relationship to estimate the missing weights from known lengths. For Dover sole, sablefish and longspine thornyhead, male and female length-weight relationships were estimated separately and the average of these relationships used to determine weights for individuals where sex was not known. For shortspine thornyhead, we used a single length-weight relationship.\nIndividual fish were then allocated to age classes following Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) by using length-age relationships from the WCGBTS data to determine age-class maximum lengths. See Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) for more detail. The maximum lengths used here (Table 27.1) were taken from Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch (2020) (Table 27.1).\nThe proportional biomass of juveniles in each subsample was calculated and used to estimate the total biomass of juvenile fishes in the full trawl.\nTrawl biomass was then used in the following sdmTMB species distribution models.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 27.1: Length, age, and depth range information.\n\n\n\nCommon nameSpeciesMax length (cm)Age classDepth range (m)Arrowtooth flounderAtheresthes stomias22150-470Darkblotched rockfishSebastes crameri150-180-240Dover soleMicrostomus pacificus171-250-465English soleaParophrys vetulus16150-140LingcodOphiodon elongatus25050-240Longspine thornyheadSebastolobus altivelis7&lt;5385-1245Pacific grenadierCoryphaenoides acrolepis3~1490-1275Pacific hakeMerluccius productus150-150-700Pacific sanddabCitharichthys sordidus130-150-245Petrale soleEopsetta jordani211-250-200SablefishAnoplopoma fimbria29050-475Shortspine thornyheadSebastolobus alascanus8&lt;5160-625Splitnose rockfishSebastes diploproa100-165-460\n\n\n\n\n\nCoastwide juvenile groundfish abundances were estimated using a spatially explicit, species distribution model evaluated with the sdmTMB package in R. The response variable was CPUE quantified as kg of juveniles per km2. The models included one common intercept across years, and spatial and spatiotemporal random fields, with anisotropy to account for different rates of autocorrelation with latitude versus longitude (~ depth). The common intercept prevents the model from forcing biomass to increase or decrease coastwide in a given year (thereby potentially overestimating recruitment in some areas) as would be the case for yearly intercept. Normalized depth was included to account for differences in density across depths.\nTo avoid projecting to areas with zero biomass, the depth range of the data used for each species in the analysis was restricted based on the distribution of positive biomass observations (Table K.1). Again, the values used here follow Tolimieri et al. (2020) with the exception that the lower depth limit for sablefish was set to 250 m, which encompasses more than 99% of their observed juvenile biomass. Pass was included as a fixed factor (as a proxy for time of year; the WCGBTS conducts two coastwide passes each year, in May-July and August-October). Models were fit with a delta-gamma distribution to account for the prevalence of zeros in the data, and the mesh was set to 10 km, resulting in 650-800 knots depending upon species. Model fits were then extrapolated to a 2x2 km grid of the West Coast to estimate total abundance in kg for juveniles in a given year. For some species, it was necessary to combine age or size classes to obtain enough data for models to converge. The resulting biomass estimate was converted to an index scaled between 0-1 by dividing all values by the maximum upper 95% confidence limit in the time series.\nTo address previous suggestions by the SSC-ES, we also evaluated models with year included as a fixed factor or allowed year to have a random intercept. When included as a fixed factor, models failed to converge likely due to identifiability problems due to also including the spatiotemporal random field. For sablefish and Dover sole, inclusion of year with a random intercept also created fit problems leading to very large standard errors for some estimated parameters. Therefore, we excluded the term from the final models.\n2025-01 Update\nPreviously models for all species included a delta-poisson-link-gamma model/error structure and normalized depth as a linear variable. In 2025 models were updated to tailor model structure and the form of depth (linear, quadratic, smoothed) to individuals species. We fit models with Tweedie, delta-lognormal, delta-poisson-link-gamma, and delta-gamma model/errors. Depth was normalized and included as a linear variabe, as a quadratic, smoothed (GAM), or not included. The best model was chosen for each species based on a comparison of AIC values, QQ residual plots, and sanity (model fit) output (Table 27.2). This approach produced better residuals and tended to dampen some of the higher biomass estimates (see sablefish in the main report).\n\n\n\n\nTable 27.2: Model informaiton for juvenile abundance models used in the FY2025 report.\n\n\n\nSpeciesDistributionDepthArrowtooth flounderTweedieGAM smoothDarkblotch rockfishTweedieGAM smoothDover soledelta-gamma-poisson-linkquadraticEnglish soledelta-gammaquadraticLingcodTweediequadraticLongspine thornyheaddelta-lognormalGAM smoothPacific grenadierdelta-gammaGAM smoothPacific hakeTweedieGAM smoothPacific sandlanceTweediequadraticPetrale soledelta-lognormalquadraticSablefishdelta-lognormalquadraticShortspine thornyheadTweediequadraticSplitnose rockfishTweedieGAM smooth\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnderson, Sean C, Eric J Ward, Philina A English, and Lewis AK Barnett. 2022. “sdmTMB: an R package for fast, flexible, and user-friendly generalized linear mixed effects models with spatial and spatiotemporal random fields.” bioRxiv, 2022–03.\n\n\nThorson, James T. 2019. “Guidance for decisions using the Vector Autoregressive Spatio-Temporal (VAST) package in stock, ecosystem, habitat and climate assessments.” Fisheries Research 210: 143–61.\n\n\nTolimieri, Nick, John Wallace, and Melissa Haltuch. 2020. “Spatio-temporal patterns in juvenile habitat for 13 groundfishes in the California Current Ecosystem.” PloS One 15 (8): e0237996.",

We analyzed 12 species that make up a large component of landings for vessels using bottom trawl gear along the West Coast, or that have broader management interest (e.g., shortbelly rockfish).\nThe present analysis differs from Selden et al. (2020) in three ways:\n1- We estimated the spatial distribution of species using the R package sdmTMB (Anderson et al. 2022) instead of VAST (Thorson 2019). The sdmTMB models included Pass and normalized depth as fixed parameters. Year was a time variable and models included both spatial and spatiotemporal (iid) autocorrelation, and a delta-poisson-link-gamma error distribution (Thorson 2018).\n2- We used the Location Biomass directly instead of scaling it by spawning stock biomass from the assessment. Thus, the Availability Index is a relative biomass index and not actual available biomass. Biomass was then scaled to 0-1 for presentation by dividing by the highest value in any year.\n3- We used only the WCGBTS, and did not combine the Triennial survey (1980-2004) with the WCGBTS. This approach shortens the analysis period but allows us to expand the depth range to 55-1250 m.\n2025-01 Update Previous sdmTMB models used a delta-poisson-link-gamma model structure/distribution and included depth a linear factor. In 2025 (for the CY2025 ESR), models were updated to use a delta-lognormal model structure, and normalized depth was included as a smoothed variable (with three knots). The delta-lognormal models produced better residuals (as evaluate with QQ-plots) than the delta-poisson-link-gamma models. The smoothed depth term allowed non-linear relationships with depth, such as higher mid-depth abundance versus shallow and deeper zones.\nIndicator Category Ecological Integrity\nData Steward N.

    "text": "Description Biomass and recruitment estimates for many HMS stocks that occupy the California Current are available from stock assessments conducted by collaborators under the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC) or the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC).\n2024-01 Update The only assessment updates since the 2023-24 ecosystem status report are for Pacific bluefin tuna, skipjack tuna, and bigeye tuna. The 2024 bigeye tuna assessment underwent several changes since the last benchmark assessment (Xu 2024). The assessment uses a risk analysis approach, encompassing three levels of hypotheses structured hierarchically to address the main uncertainties in the assessment. The time-series shown here are multi-model estimates. The 2024 skipjack tuna assessment is a significant improvement over the 2022 interim assessment (Bi 2024). It reflects major advancements in the assessment methodologies and incorporates new data sets, including tagging data. The Pacific bluefin tuna assessment also included some improvements to the model used in the last (2022) benchmark assessment (ISC 2024). One of the major changes made was to shorten the assessment time period to start in 1983 instead of 1952. This adjustment was implemented because more reliable data were available after 1983. For all species, we emphasize that the status and trends symbols shown in our status and trend figures reflect short-term patterns relative to time series averages (with a period of reference of 1991-2020), and do not necessarily reflect reference points based on, e.g., unfished stock biomass.\nIndicators\n\n\nSpecies:\n\nAlbacore:Recruits (x1000)\nBigeye tuna:Recuitment\nBlue marlin:Recruits (x1000)\nBluefin tuna:Recruitment\nNorth Pacific swordfish:Recruits (x1000)\nSkipjack tuna:Recruitment\nYellowfin tuna:Recruitment\n\nComponent Category: Highly Migratory Species\nTime Range: 1994 - 2021\nCCIEA Data Contact: barbara.muhling@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA SWFSC/FRD\nSource Data: Estimates of annual recruitment are derived from the stock assessment model. The latest (2023) stock assessment report was completed through the International Scientific Committee for Tuna and Tuna-like Species in the North Pacific Ocean (ISC). North Pacific albacore are considered to be one stock throughout the North Pacific Ocean. They are fished throughout their range by multiple countries, mostly using surface gear (troll and pole and line), as well as pelagic longlines and other gears. Their population dynamics are assessed using an age-, length- and sex-structured model (Stock Synthesis v3). The assessment model used was similar to that in the 2017 benchmark assessment, with four important changes: 1) adjusting coefficients of variation for the abundance index in 2020-21 to better reflect uncertainty surrounding disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic, 2) adjustments to Japan longline fleet structure, 3) adjustments to adult abundance indices, and 4) adjustments to age selectivity. The full assessment is available from http://isc.fra.go.jp/reports/stock_assessments.html.

    "text": "Description California sea lion pup counts and pup growth rates are sensitive indicators of prey availability and composition in the Central and Southern CCE.\nPup count and pup growth as indicators of foraging conditions: The San Miguel Island California sea lion indicators of pup births, pup condition, pup growth and nursing female diet are linked to the availability (a combination of abundance and distribution) and composition of the coastal pelagic forage community to nursing California sea lions foraging in the CCE from the northern California Channel Islands to Monterey Bay throughout the year. Nursing California sea lions are central place foragers for 11 months of the year, traveling to and from the breeding colonies in the Channel Islands, where their pups reside, to foraging areas within 200 km of the colonies. Consequently, they are sampling the coastal pelagic forage community throughout the year and their diet and resultant reproductive success measured by pup metrics depends on the availability of that forage community.\nNursing California sea lions consume a variety of fish and cephalopods but have a core diet of only seven taxa: Pacific hake, Pacific sardine, northern anchovy, rockfish, jack mackerel, Pacific mackerel, and market squid S. Melin, DeLong, and Siniff (2008); S. R. Melin, Orr, et al. (2012)]. These taxa vary annually and seasonally in the diet. The nursing female diet index is based on the frequency of occurrence of these seven core taxa in scats collected at the San Miguel colony during the early lactation period (June-September). This index provides a relative measure of the availability of each prey taxa to nursing females within their foraging range because California sea lions consume prey relative to its abundance in the environment (Thompson et al. 2019) but not necessarily proportionally. For example, an increase in the frequency of occurrence of anchovy from 5% in 1995 diets to 90% in 1996 diets means that almost no females consumed anchovy in 1995 because it was not available to them but almost all females consumed it in 1996; it does not necessarily mean that the biomass of anchovy increased nearly 20-fold in the CCE, just that the availability increased in the foraging range of nursing females. Nonetheless, it indicates that a change in the forage community occurred between the two years. A weakness of this index is that it only indicates presence or absence of a taxa in the diet; when sardine occurs in high frequency, it could be that sea lions are exploiting a small population of fish or it could be that sardine are ubiquitous in the environment. It also is a retrospective rather than forecasting index. It is thus important to view this as part of a suite of indicators about the prey community, along with ship-based catch or acoustic estimates of forage fish biomass. Strengths of the sea lion diet index are that it is easy to update annually and the core taxa comprise the core diet of many other top predators in the CCE that are difficult to sample or observe. Consequently, the annual variability and trends in the California sea lion diet can inform us on unusual patterns in the coastal pelagic forage community that may affect other top predators in the CCE.\nEach of the pup indices in the report represents a different aspect of reproductive success that relies on successful foraging by reproductive females. As such, they are indirect qualitative measures of the forage available to reproductive females and do not provide specific forage community information. The annual number of pup births is an index of successful pregnancies, which are dependent on the nutritional condition of the female, which in turn, is dependent on the quality and quantity of prey available during the gestation period. Higher numbers of pup births indicates that females consumed a diet that provided sufficient quantity and nutrition to support the energetic cost of gestation. Pup condition and growth are dependent on milk intake. The more milk consumed the greater the better condition and growth rate. The amount of food consumed by a female on a foraging trip determines the amount of milk she has to deliver to the pup when she returns. Better pup condition and higher growth rates indicate abundant prey for nursing females during the lactation period.\nDeclines in pup births and pup growth have been associated with environmental events that reduced marine productivity at all trophic levels in the CCE for prolonged periods supporting the link between these indices and the status of the forage community (R. DeLong et al. 1991; Iverson, Oftedal, and Boness 1991; S. Melin et al. 2010; S. R. Melin, Laake, et al. 2012; R. L. DeLong et al. 2017). Other factors such as diseases (e.g., hookworm, Lyons et al. 2005), immune suppression from pollution (R. L. DeLong, Gilmartin, and Simpson 1973; Gilmartin et al. 1976) and natural environmental toxins (Goldstein et al. 2009) may affect pup growth or births, but these factors are likely to have less of a population level effect than large-scale food supply issues that accompany anomalous oceanographic conditions.\nThe influence of population abundance and carrying capacity on these indicators: In discussions related to past reports, some Council advisory bodies expressed concerns that sea lion pup counts and growth may become less effective indicators when the population is close to carrying capacity, which it was in the 2010s: according to population modeling work by Laake et al. (2018), the San Miguel colony at that time had an estimated carrying capacity of ~275,000 animals (including pups), and annual population estimates between 2006 and 2014 ranged from 242,000 to 306,000 animals. Advisory bodies were concerned that changes in pup count or growth could be due to density dependent mechanisms within the sea lion population, rather than to changes in the prey community.\nA linear mixed effects model of California sea lion pup growth that includes environmental variables, sea lion abundance, fish abundance and nursing female diet revealed that the abundance of California sea lions was not a significant factor in annual variability of pup growth rates (Melin et al. in preparation). The model also did not detect a declining trend in pup growth as the population size increased, which might occur if competition among nursing females for limited forage was affecting the ability of females to support the energetic demands of their pups. Elevated SST explained the greatest amount of variability for pup growth rates in the models: a 1°C increase in SST resulted in a 7% decline in the population growth rate, even when the population was much smaller (&lt;100,000 animals) in the 1980s (Laake et al. 2018). The reverse effect was not apparent when SST decreased by 1°C. These analyses indicate that pup count and pup growth are not compromised as indicators by population size, but rather reflect the dynamic relationship between environmental conditions and California sea lion reproduction. We believe the key underlying mechanism is that elevated SST affects the distribution and abundance of the sea lion prey community thereby reducing access to food for nursing females, such that they cannot support the energetic demands of pregnancy, resulting in fewer births, or lactation, resulting in slower pup growth.\n2023 Methods Update To reduce disturbance to California sea lions and to improve the accuracy of our pup counts, we transitioned to using small drones (Aerial Imagery Systems’ APH-28 and the Parrot Anafi) for our pup census in 2023. A pilot study in 2017 and 2018 that paired drone surveys and ground counts for the same areas showed no significant differences in counts determined from drones or ground counts. The drone surveys were flown at an altitude of 46 m over small or narrow sections of coastline or in transects over large areas. The images were stitched together using DigiKam software and pups were counted using DotDotGoose software that automatically entered the counts into a data file for analysis. In 2023, weather conditions precluded using the drones for the entire count so we conducted ground counts for about 20% of the colony and used drones for 80%.\nIndicators\nFemale sea lion pup growth rate\n\nComponent Category: Marine Mammals\nTime Range: 1997 - 2023\nCCIEA Data Contact: sharon.melin@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA AFSC/MML\nSource Data: AFSC/NMML)\nAdditional Calculations: Predicted average (+/-1 s.e.) daily growth rate of female California sea lion pups at San Miguel Island between 4-7 months of age for cohorts from 1997-present.

    "text": "Description Harmful algal blooms (HABs) of diatoms in the genus Pseudo-nitzschia have been a recurring concern along the West Coast. Certain species of Pseudo-nitzschia produce the toxin domoic acid, which can accumulate in filter feeders and extend through food webs to cause harmful or lethal effects on people, marine mammals, and seabirds (Lefebvre et al. 2002; McCabe et al. 2016). Because domoic acid can cause amnesic shellfish poisoning in humans, fisheries that target shellfish (including razor clam, Dungeness crab, rock crab, and spiny lobster) are delayed, closed, or operate under special orders or health advisories when domoic acid concentrations exceed regulatory thresholds for human consumption. Fishery closures can cost tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue, and cause a range of sociocultural impacts in fishing communities (Dyson and Huppert 2010; Ritzman et al. 2018; Holland and Leonard 2020; Moore et al. 2020), including a “spillover” of fishing effort into other fisheries.\nOcean conditions associated with marine heatwaves, El Niño events, or positive PDO regimes may further exacerbate domoic acid toxicity and fishery impacts, and domoic acid toxicity tracks anomalies of southern copepod biomass (Fig. 3.1) (McCabe et al. 2016; McKibben et al. 2017). The largest and most toxic HAB of Pseudo-nitzschia on the West Coast occurred in 2015, coincident with the 2013-2016 marine heatwave, and caused the longest-lasting and most widespread HAB-related fisheries closures on record (McCabe et al. 2016; Moore et al. 2019; Trainer et al. 2020). Closures and delays in the opening of West Coast crab fisheries resulted in the appropriation of &gt;$25M in federal disaster relief funds (McCabe et al. 2016).\nAccording to thresholds set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, domoic acid levels ≥20 parts per million (ppm) trigger actions for all seafood and tissues except Dungeness crab viscera, for which the level is &gt;30 ppm (California applies this to rock crab viscera as well) (Fda 2011). Under evisceration orders, Dungeness crab can be landed when the viscera exceeds the threshold but the meat does not, provided that crab are eviscerated by a licensed processor. Oregon was the first West Coast state to pass legislation allowing evisceration, in November 2017, followed by California in October 2021. Washington adopted an emergency evisceration rule in February 2021, and is considering legislation to grant long-term authority for issuing evisceration orders.\nIndicator Category Ecological Integrity\nData Steward S.

Free, who submit unpublished figures and plots to the CCIEA editorial team.

These activities generate many benefits, including production of food, employment, energy and livelihoods (Guerry et al. 2012). However, they are also associated with pressures on the ecosystem that have negative consequences, such as loss or modification of habitat, depletions and introductions of species, physical, visual and auditory disturbances, and toxic and non-toxic contamination (Eastwood et al. 2007). Despite the increasing urgency of these influences (Halpern et al. 2007), it is rare to have a full accounting of how anthropogenic pressures in the marine environment have changed over time.\nWe developed standardized time series of indicators for a variety of anthropogenic pressures (e.g., trawl bottom contact, commercial shipping, nutrient input) acting across the entire USA’s portion of the California Current Large Marine Ecosystem (Andrews et al. 2015). These time series were used to quantify and evaluate the intensity and temporal trends of each pressure. Our synthesis, and corresponding methodological approaches to quantify the intensity and trends of these pressures, provide a foundation for future integrative analyses on ecological components (such as risk analysis and management strategy evaluations) across the CCE.\nIndicators\n\n\nSpecies:\n\nCommercial shipping - distance\nFinfish Aquaculture\nNutrient Input\nOil And Gas Activity\nSeafood consumption (per capita)\nSeafood consumption (total)\nShellfish Aquaculture\n\nComponent Category: Human Activities\nTime Range: 1997 - 2018\nCCIEA Data Contact: kelly.andrews@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA NWFSC\nSource Data: Domestic vessel data from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Navigation Data Center (New Orleans, LA) and foreign vessel data from http://www.ndc.iwr.usace.army.mil/data/dataclen.htm.\nAdditional Calculations: Commercial shipping activity (distance) was measured as the distance traveled by commercial vessels during transit within waters of the California Current.

Six broad-scale indicators of long-term, spatial variation in oceanography and lower-trophic level productivity are being used to inform spatial suitability analyses in areas off northern California being considered for OWE development in 2024. The ecosystem indicators include: 1. Average wind-driven upwelling during March-July, calculated at 40m depth from 1988-2012 using the Regional Ocean Modeling System (Raghukumar et al. 2023); 2. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots in primary productivity, calculated from a biogeochemistry model as the average concentration of surface phytoplankton in May-July, 1995-2020 (Fiechter, Edwards, and Moore 2018); 3. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots in secondary productivity from May-August, calculated as an ensemble of four different estimates of krill abundance/biomass across the West Coast (Cimino et al. 2020; Fiechter et al. 2020; Messié et al. 2022; Phillips et al. 2022); 4. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots for young-of-year (YOY) rockfishes during their pelagic juvenile life stage in May-June from 2001-2022 (Field et al. 2021); 5.Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots for YOY Pacific hake in May-June from 2001-2022 (Field et al. 2021); 6. Long-term, spatial variability and hotspots of groundfish nursery habitat on the seafloor, based on summed average densities of juveniles from 13 groundfish species in May-October from 2003-2018 (Tolimieri, Wallace, and Haltuch 2020).\nIndicator Category Fishing and Non-Fishing Human Activities\nData Steward Andrews; kelly.andrews at noaa.gov\nInstitution NOAA NWFSC/SWFSC; WCR\nAdditional Information Data are collected and analyzed independently by K. Andrews and team, who submit internally reviewed figures and plots to the CCIEA editorial team.\nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has been using a spatial suitability analysis developed by NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal and Ocean Science (NCCOS) to identify areas BOEM may consider for OWE development. In order to inform an analysis of new areas along the northern California coast, we used BOEM’s methods to calculate an overall suitability score across the six ecosystem indicators for each grid cell (Riley et al. 2021). Briefly, the raw data for each indicator was cropped to the area-of-interest, interpolated across a 2x2-km spatial grid, transformed using a z-membership function, and then geometrically averaged across all indicators for each grid cell. This geometric mean represents the suitability score of a grid cell for OWE development relative to the importance of these areas to the processes represented by each indicator; thus, a suitability score of ‘1’ is most suitable for OWE, while suitability scores closer to 0 are less suitable. In addition to being applicable to siting of new areas, these indicators could be used to establish baseline conditions that can be used to identify potential effects resulting from OWE development and to identify relevant mitigation strategies.\nData sources\nFisheries Indicators.* We developed seven indicators that describe spatial and temporal variation in groundfish bottom trawling activity from 2002-2021 in the same region being considered for OWE development off the coast of northern California. These indicators were presented in the 2022 ESR (Harvey et al. 2022) and are meant to capture the spatial and temporal variation in fishing effort for the groundfish bottom trawl fishery and to be used in tandem with the ecosystem indicators to identify potential interactions across the entire social-ecological system.\nFor the groundfish indicators herein, we used logbook set and retrieval coordinates from the limited-entry/catch shares groundfish bottom trawl fisheries to estimate total duration trawled on a 2x2-km grid. These durations were then used to calculate: 1. total duration trawled in the most recent year (2021); 2. the anomaly of the most recent year relative to the entire time series; 3. the most recent 5-year mean (2017-2021); 4. the most recent 5-year trend (2017-2021); 5. the sum of duration trawled across all years; 6. the proportion of years trawled; and 7. the number of years since trawling occurred within each grid cell.\nTo maintain confidentiality, grid cells with &lt;3 vessels operating within the grid cell across the years associated with the indicator have been removed. The first four indicators are consistent with measuring the ‘status’ and ‘trends’ of other ecosystem indicators presented in this report, while the last three have been developed as indicators to use within a risk analysis framework. These indicators account for only federal limited-entry/catch shares groundfish bottom trawl fisheries from 2002-2021, but provide a useful framework for identifying the potential for overlap and conflict between day-to-day fisheries operations and OWE areas. Other fisheries were included in a similar framework and will be added as analyses are completed.\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCimino, Megan A, Jarrod A Santora, Isaac Schroeder, William Sydeman, Michael G Jacox, Elliott L Hazen, and Steven J Bograd. 2020. “Essential Krill Species Habitat Resolved by Seasonal Upwelling and Ocean Circulation Models Within the Large Marine Ecosystem of the California Current System.” Ecography 43 (10): 1536–49.\n\n\nFiechter, Jerome, Christopher A Edwards, and Andrew M Moore. 2018. “Wind, Circulation, and Topographic Effects on Alongshore Phytoplankton Variability in the California Current.” Geophysical Research Letters 45 (7): 3238–45.\n\n\nFiechter, Jerome, Jarrod A Santora, Francisco Chavez, Devon Northcott, and Monique Messié. 2020. “Krill Hotspot Formation and Phenology in the California Current Ecosystem.” Geophysical Research Letters 47 (13): e2020GL088039.\n\n\nField, John C, Rebecca R Miller, Jarrod A Santora, Nick Tolimieri, Melissa A Haltuch, Richard D Brodeur, Toby D Auth, et al. 2021. “Spatiotemporal Patterns of Variability in the Abundance and Distribution of Winter-Spawned Pelagic Juvenile Rockfish in the California Current.” PloS One 16 (5): e0251638.\n\n\nHarvey, Chris J, Newell Toby Garfield, Gregory D Williams, and Nicholas Tolimieri. 2022. “California Current Integrated Ecosystem Assessment (CCIEA) California Current Ecosystem Status Report, 2022.

    "text": "Description The Community Social Vulnerability Index (CSVI) is an indicator of social vulnerability in coastal communities that are dependent upon commercial fishing (Norman 2007). To gain further insight into community vulnerability in relation to commercial fishing, fishing dependence, which can be expressed in terms of engagement, reliance, or by a composite of both, can be considered in relation to CSVI. Engagement refers to the total extent of fishing activity in a community; it can be expressed in terms of commercial activity (e.g., landings, revenues, permits, processing, etc). Reliance is the per capita engagement of a community; thus, in two communities with equal engagement, the community with the smaller population would have a higher reliance on its fisheries activities.\nSimilar to the commercial fishing reliance and engagement measures produced as a part of the Community Social Vulnerability Index (CSVI), we have developed index measures for recreational fishing engagement and reliance (Lewis-Smith and Norman 2024), absent in prior versions of this report as consistent annual data had not been identified. As with the commercial fishing Index construction, following the method proposed by Jepson and Colburn (2013), data directly linking place-based communities to the economic aspects of recreational fishing, which could be attributed to specific calendar years, were compiled from six distinct sources as inputs for the measures. Charter and guide permit data collected by state managers were obtained and linked to Census-Designated Place (CDP) based communities. Additionally, historic fishing tackle business location data was compiled from Data Axel, the provider of business location data to Environmental Systems Research Institute’s (ESRI) business analyst application. Marina business location data was also obtained from ESRI and ESRI’s provider. These data enable interannual comparisons and allow for future replicable iterations.\nCommunities that score highly in either commercial or recreational reliance in addition to higher social vulnerability scores may be especially socially vulnerable to downturns in fishing. Fishing reliance can be volatile: communities can move left on the x-axis in years with reduced landings, and may thus appear to be less dependent on commercial fishing when in fact they have actually just experienced a difficult year; therefore, these results should be interpreted with care. These same qualifications apply to recreational fishing reliance measures, and several communities are among the most reliant in their respective regions for both commercial and recreational fishing. These data are difficult to groundtruth and interpreting trends requires further study.\n\n\nCommunities (ordered north to south):\n\nBellingham, WA\nNeah Bay, WA\nAnacortes, WA\nWestport, WA\nSeattle, WA\nTokeland, WA\nShelton, WA\nBay Center, WA\nOlympia, WA\nIlwaco, WA\nChinook, WA\nAstoria, OR\nGaribaldi, OR\nTillamook, OR\nBeaver, OR\nCloverdale, OR\nNewport, OR\nFlorence, OR\nCoos Bay, OR\nYachats, OR\nPort Orford, OR\nWinchester Bay, OR\nBrookings, OR\nCrescent City, CA\nTrinidad, CA\nEureka, CA\nShelter Cove, CA\nFort Bragg, CA\nPoint Arena, CA\nBodega Bay, CA\nDillon Beach, CA\nTomales, CA\nBolinas, CA\nSan Francisco, CA\nEl Granada, CA\nHalf Moon Bay, CA\nMoss Landing, CA\nMonterey, CA\nMorro Bay, CA\nSanta Barbara, CA\nSummerland, CA\nSan Buenaventura (Ventura), CA\nOxnard, CA\nPort Hueneme, CA\nMarina del Rey, CA\nLos Angeles, CA\nDana Point, CA\nAvalon, CA\nDel Mar, CA\nSan Diego, CA\n\nComponent Category: Human Wellbeing\nCCIEA Data Contact: karma.norman@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA NWFSC\nSource Data: Community social vulnerability index (CSVI) data were provided by Dr. Karma Norman (NOAA), and are derived from the American Community Survey (ACS) associated with the US Census (http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml).

    "text": "Description Catches and prices from many fisheries exhibit high interannual variability, leading to high variability in fisher’s revenue, but variability can be reduced by diversifying activities across multiple fisheries or regions (Kasperski and Holland 2013). Individuals may have good reasons to specialize, including reduced costs or greater efficiency; thus while diversification may reduce income variation, it does not necessarily promote higher average profitability. We use the Effective Shannon Index (ESI) to examine diversification of fishing revenue for more than 28,000 vessels fishing off the West Coast and Alaska over the last 40 years. The ESI increases as revenues are spread across more fisheries, and as revenues are spread more evenly across fisheries; ESI = 1 when a vessel’s revenues are from a single species group and region; ESI = 2 if revenues are spread evenly across 2 fisheries; ESI = 3 if revenues are spread evenly across 3 fisheries; and so on. If revenue is not evenly distributed across fisheries, then the ESI value is lower than the number of fisheries a vessel enters.\nDiversification can take other forms. Spreading effort and catch over the year, or simply fishing more weeks of the year, can both increase revenue and decrease interannual variation of revenue just as species diversification does. In fact, Abbott, Sakai, and Holland (2023) showed that reductions in revenue variation associated with species diversification can be explained mainly by increased temporal diversification, which can be achieved by fishing in multiple fisheries but also by fishing for more weeks of the year in a single fishery. Effective Shannon Index can also be used to examine how widely and evenly vessel revenues are spread across weeks of the year as an indicator or temporal diversification. Like the species diversification metric, this index increases the more weeks of the year a vessel has revenue and the more evenly that revenue is distributed across weeks. A vessel fishing 15 weeks of the year with the same revenue each of those weeks would have a temporal ESI of 15, and that number would decline as revenue is spread less evenly over the 15 weeks.\n\n\nIndicators:\n\nvess_rev_5k\nvess_rev_5k_fish_2023\nvess_rev_5k_fish_1981-2023\nvess_rev_5k_fish_1981\nvess_rev_5_25k\nvess_rev_25-100k\nvess_rev_100k\nvess_rev_5k_len_40\nvess_rev_5k_len_41-80\nvess_rev_5k_len_81-125\nvess_2023_WA_rev_5k\nvess_2023_OR_rev_5k\nvess_2023_CA_rev_5k\nvess_2023_WC_rev_5k_ave_5k-25k\nvess_2023_WC_rev_5k_ave_25-100k\nvess_2023_WC_rev_5k_ave_100k\nvess_2023_WC_rev_5k_len_40\nvess_2023_WC_rev_5k_len_41-80\nvess_2023_WC_rev_5k_len_81-125\nPort of Bellingham, WA\nPort of Seattle, WA\nPort of Westport, WA\nPort of Ilwaco, WA\nPort of Astoria, OR\nPort of Newport, OR\nPort of Charleston, OR\nPort of Brookings, OR\nPort of Crescent City, CA\nPort of Eureka, CA\nPort of Fort Bragg, CA\nPort of San Francisco, CA\nPort of Moss Landing, CA\nPort of Santa Barbara, CA\nPort of Ventura, CA\nPort of San Pedro, CA\n\nComponent Category: Human Wellbeing\nTime Range: 1981 - 2023\nCCIEA Data Contact: dan.holland@noaa.gov\nInstitution: NOAA NWFSC/AFSC\nSource Data: Data derived from Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) and Alaska Fisheries Information Network (AKFIN).

    "text": "Description Compared to many other professions, fishers face unusually high year-to-year variability in their income levels. Diversifying fishing income can help reduce income variability and reduce financial risk, but focusing solely on diversification opportunities within the fishery misses a potentially important form of financial risk reduction - income diversification from non-fishing occupations (i.e., livelihood diversification). Livelihood diversification may actually be a more effective form of financial risk reduction for fishing households if their non-fishing income streams are unaffected by changes in fishery productivity or profitability or if they can be actively increased when fishing income is low.\nLevels and trends in non-fishery income diversification have not been presented previously due to a lack of regularly collected data on non-fishery income (NFI). To address this and other informational gaps, the NWFSC began periodically surveying West Coast fishing vessel owners on a triennial basis with surveys carried out in 2017, 2020, and 2023. Surveys were sent to all vessel owners with commercial revenue from West Coast fisheries (federal and state) the prior year. Response rates were around 50% in 2017 and 2020 with over 1400 surveys returned each year. The response rate in 2023 fell to 40% with 1163 surveys returned.\nAmong other questions, the surveys ask fishing vessel owners what percentage of their household income came from fishing versus non-fishing sources in the prior calendar year (e.g. 2022 for the 2023 survey) and also what percentage of the income they personally contribute to the household is from non-fishery sources. The survey also asks vessel owners that personally contributed NFI to their household what type of non-fishing work they did. Treakle and Holland (2023) provides a detailed analysis of the survey data on non-fishing income from the 2017 and 2020 surveys.\nIndicator Category Human Wellbeing\nData Steward Dan Holland; dan.holland at noaa.gov\nInstitution NOAA NWFSC/AFSC\nAdditional Information Data are collected and analyzed independently by D.

    "text": "Description Vessel-level fisheries participation networks (FPNs] provide a visual representation of the portfolio of fisheries that are economically-important to individual vessels within a port group and represent how diversified harvest portfolios create connections between fisheries (Fuller et al. 2017; Fisher et al. 2021). FPNs have shown how West Coast networks change over time, how groundfish fisheries are connected to other fisheries in different IO-PAC port groups (Chris J. Harvey et al. 2022), and the vulnerability of West Coast port groups to future shocks to salmon fishing, based on economic dependence (a measure of sensitivity) and a resilience index based on fisheries connectivity (a measure of adaptive capacity) (Harvey et al. 2023). More recently, we compare the number of active salmon vessels and the revenue of commercial salmon vessels between two periods (2017-2022 and 2022-2023) for West Coast port groups.\nAs fishers diversify their harvest portfolios, they create connections between fisheries, even when ecological links between the target species are weak or absent. In previous reports (Chris J. Harvey et al. 2021, 2022; C. J. Harvey et al. 2023; Leising et al. 2024), we used fisheries participation networks (Fuller et al. 2017; Fisher et al. 2021) as a way to represent this information about how fisheries are connected through shared participation patterns. In these networks, fisheries are depicted as nodes, and pairs of nodes are connected by lines called ‘edges’ that integrate information about vessels participating in both fisheries. Changes in network structure over time reflect changes in the ecology of adjacent coastal waters, as well as the legacy of management, markets, and other factors.\nIndicator Category Human Wellbeing\nData Steward Samhouri; jameal.samhouri@noaa.gov\nAdditional Information Data are collected and analyzed independently by J. Samhouri, who submits unpublished figures and plots to the CCIEA editorial team.\nData sources The networks are derived from landings receipts and summarized annually from week 46 in one year through week 45 in the following year (e.g., November 2020 to November 2021) to capture the beginning of the Dungeness crab fishing season. Fisheries landings data were retrieved from the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN; http://pacfin.psmfc.org) database. We note that in Washington, fish tickets include a port assigned based on the actual port of landing or derived from the license database; prior to 2018, most port data were derived.\nData extraction To focus the analysis on vessels that derive a substantial amount of income from commercial fishing, we include only vessels that generate at least $5,000 annually in total fisheries revenue. In addition, vessels must generate at least $500 of revenue from a given fishery (node) to be included as participants in that fishery. We assume that economically-important fisheries are those that contribute to at least a median of 10% of the annual revenue of associated vessels. Vessels are represented in all port groups for which their landings meet these conditions. To maintain confidentiality, we include only fisheries with at least three vessels participating in a port group.\nIn network graphs, node size represents the median proportional contribution of a fishery to annual vessel-level revenue; it is scaled relative to the fishery with the maximum median proportional contribution to annual vessel-level revenue in each network, summarized by port group. Therefore, node sizes are not comparable across port groups, only within them. The edges connecting pairs of nodes indicate that vessels participate in both fisheries, and the widths of these edges scale with the number of vessels exhibiting this behavior, as well as the total amount and evenness of revenue generation from each pair of fisheries. As with node sizes, edge widths are not comparable across port groups, only within them.\nData analysis\nReferences\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFisher, Mary C, Stephanie K Moore, Sunny L Jardine, James R Watson, and Jameal F Samhouri. 2021. “Climate shock effects and mediation in fisheries.” Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences 118 (2): e2014379117.\n\n\nFuller, Emma C, Jameal F Samhouri, Joshua S Stoll, Simon A Levin, and James R Watson. 2017. “Characterizing fisheries connectivity in marine social–ecological systems.” ICES Journal of Marine Science 74 (8): 2087–96.\n\n\nHarvey, C.
